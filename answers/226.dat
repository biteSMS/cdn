int main() {
  double output = 100;
  double CURRENT = 100, growRate;
  int year;
  printf("Input grow rate:");
  scanf("%lf", &growRate);

  for (year = 0; output < 2 * CURRENT; year++) {
    output = output * (1 + growRate);
  }

  printf(
      "When grow rate is %.0f%%, the output can be doubled after %d years.\n",
      growRate * 100, year);
  return 0;
